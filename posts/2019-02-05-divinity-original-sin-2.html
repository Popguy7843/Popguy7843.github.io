<h1 class="title">I just played an hour of Divinity: Original Sin 2</h1>
</header><p>
I start out as a prisoner on a ship (I don’t really remember much more).
I get killed a few times as I figure out what exactly I’m supposed to do, once by a magister and another by a lone sheep.
Eventually, after many mistakes, I understand how to play.
</p>

<p>
I find a fellow prisoner, except he is behind bars.
He asks me whether I could free him by pulling the lever.
I accept his request, expecting he return the favor.
Just as I am about to pull the lever, the guard on duty wakes up, thinking that his shift is over, only to find that I’m not his supervisor, but a Sourcerer.
I fail to persuade him to leave, so I pull the lever and free the prisoner as we begin to fight.
The fight ends pretty quickly, as the prisoner has powerful fire abilities.
I was happy that I now have a friend, or so I thought.
He instantly begins to attack me, after finishing off the guard, remarking how he promised to “free” me.
</p>

<p>
Though it was tough, I was able to flee the other prisoner and climb up the ladder where I found myself in the safety of a magistrate.
Trying to test how the suspicion system worked, I secretly steal a book behind the magistrates back and then get her to notice the missing book.
She immediately notices the missing book and demands that I be searched.
I allow her to search me and to no one’s surprise, she find’s the stolen book and the fight begins.
I end up fleeing and climbing down the ladder, as the magistrate is far too powerful.
</p>

<p>
I climb back up the ladder, expecting the magistrate to persist her hostility towards me, however instead she stands idly.
In some sense I was kind of disappointed, yet also very relieved.
</p>

<p>
As I pass by her, I find that appears to have been a murder on the ship.
The investigation is ongoing and I should not involve myself with it.
</p>

<p>
Later on, I find myself among many other prisoner Sourcerers, all wearing the same bright green necklace as mine, preventing Sourcerers to use their abilities.
I converse with many of them and it was very enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
After talking to the other Sourcerers, I come to a room in which a Sourcerer who seems to be an old lady is being interrogated by three magistrates.
She declares that she is the one who committed the murder on the ship and goes as far as to say there are more people on the ship who need to be killed.
She somehow takes off her necklace and proceeds to explode, killing every magistrate on board, while knocking out every Sourcerer on board.
</p>

<p>
I wake up from being knocked out, only to realize the ship is sinking fast and the sea is rushing in.
I look around, picking up random objects, not really knowing what to do until I find a staircase leading up to the deck.
As I emerge from the staircase, I see a magistrate and two large bugs.
The magistrate is swiftly obliterated at the whip of a massive Kraken-like tentacle, leaving the two bugs remaining.
I easily deal with the bugs using my handy crossbow and AoE poison ability.
</p>

<p>
I roam the deck, looking for some sort of life boat and find one.
There is one life boat that has yet to depart and on it are two dwarves and a child.
The dwarves cannot figure out how to lower the boat, but insist they must leave the others on board behind, as the ship is bound to sink at any moment.
The child opposes, saying that the others on the ship must be saved.
</p>

<p>
I decide that I should save the others on board and descend the ladders leading downwards into the doomed ship.
To my surprise, the Sourcerers all wake from their unconcious state as I arrive, while bugs start to spawn out of nowhere.
</p>

<p>
The bugs are easily dealt with and we begin to depart the ship.
Ultimately, we were too late and everyone on the ship died as the giant squid creature encased the ship in its many tentacles.
</p>

<p>
As I fell into the depths of the ocean, some sort of god-like voice spoke, saying something along the lines of “I have still plans for you, child”.
I wake up on the coast of Fort Joy as the only one alive.
